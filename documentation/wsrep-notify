Node Status Strings

The notification script may pass one of six values for the --status parameter to indicate the current state of the node:

    Undefined indicates a starting node that is not part of the Primary Component.
    Joiner indicates a node that is part of the Primary Component and is receiving a state snapshot transfer.
    Donor indicates a node that is part of the Primary Component and is sending a state snapshot transfer.
    Joined indicates a node that is part of the Primary Component and is in a complete state and is catching up with the cluster.
    Synced indicates a node that is syncrhonized with the cluster.
    Error indicates that an error has occurred. This status string may provide an error code with more information on what occurred.

--status joined --uuid 5195fa9f-eabe-11ea-a52c-567e4a46a250 --primary yes --index 0 --members e875b9e0-04df-11eb-bf25-daaf30988227/192.168.1.61/AUTO
